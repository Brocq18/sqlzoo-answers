1 ) Modify it to show the population of Germany

SELECT population FROM world
WHERE name = 'Germany'

2) Show the name and the population for 'Ireland', 'Iceland' and 'Denmark'.

SELECT name, population FROM world
WHERE name IN ('Ireland', 'Iceland', 'Denmark');

3) Which countries are not too small and not too big? BETWEEN allows range checking (range specified 
is inclusive of boundary values). The example below shows countries with an area of 
250,000-300,000 sq. km. Modify it to show the country and the area for countries with an area between 
200,000 and 250,000.

SELECT name, area FROM world
WHERE area BETWEEN  200000 AND 250000

1) Select the code which produces this table

SELECT name, population
FROM world
WHERE population BETWEEN 1000000 AND 1250000

2) Pick the result you would obtain from this code:

Table-E
Albania	3200000
Algeria	32900000

3) Select the code which shows the countries that end in A or L

SELECT name FROM world
WHERE name LIKE '%a' OR name LIKE '%l'

4) Pick the result from the query

name	length(name)
Italy	5
Malta	5
Spain	5

5) Pick the result you would obtain from this code:
SELECT name, area*2 FROM world WHERE population = 64000

Andorra	936

6) Select the code that would show the countries with an area larger than 50000 and a population 
smaller than 10000000

SELECT name, area, population
FROM world
WHERE area > 50000 AND population < 10000000

7) Select the code that shows the population density of China, Australia, Nigeria and France

SELECT name, population/area
FROM world
WHERE name IN ('China', 'Nigeria', 'France', 'Australia')

1) SELECT name, continent, population FROM world

2) How to use WHERE to filter records. Show the name for the countries that have a population of at 
least 200 million. 200 million is 200000000, there are eight zeros.

SELECT name FROM world
WHERE population>200000000

3) Give the name and the per capita GDP for those countries with a population of at least 200 million.

SELECT name, gdp/population
FROM world
WHERE population>200000000

4) Show the name and population in millions for the countries of the continent 'South America'. Divide 
the population by 1000000 to get population in millions.

SELECT name, population/1000000
FROM world
WHERE continent='South America'

5) Show the name and population for France, Germany, Italy

SELECT name, population FROM world
WHERE name in ('France', 'Germany', 'Italy')

6) Show the countries which have a name that includes the word 'United'

SELECT name FROM world
WHERE name LIKE '%United%'

7) Two ways to be big: A country is big if it has an area of more than 3 million sq km or it has a 
population of more than 250 million.

Show the countries that are big by area or big by population. Show name,population and area.

SELECT name, population, area FROM world
WHERE population>250000000 or area>3000000

8) Exclusive OR (XOR). Show the countries that are big by area or big by population but not both. Show 
name, population and area.

Australia has a big area but a small population, it should be included. Indonesia has a big population 
but a small area, it should be included. China has a big population and big area, it should be excluded.
United Kingdom has a small population and a small area, it should be excluded.

SELECT name, population, area FROM world
WHERE population>250000000 xor area>3000000

9) Show the name and population in millions and the GDP in billions for the countries of the continent 
'South America'. Use the ROUND function to show the values to two decimal places.

For South America show population in millions and GDP in billions both to 2 decimal places.

SELECT name, round(population/1000000,2), round(gdp/1000000000,2) FROM world
WHERE continent = 'South America'

10) Show the name and per-capita GDP for those countries with a GDP of at least one trillion 
(1000000000000; that is 12 zeros). Round this value to the nearest 1000. Show per-capita GDP for the 
trillion dollar countries to the nearest $1000.

SELECT name, round(gdp/population,-3) FROM world
WHERE gdp > 1000000000000

11) The CASE statement shown is used to substitute North America for Caribbean in the third column.
Show the name - but substitute Australasia for Oceania - for countries beginning with N.

SELECT name,
CASE WHEN continent='Oceania' THEN 'Australasia'
ELSE continent END
FROM world
WHERE name LIKE 'N%'

12) Show the name and the continent - but substitute Eurasia for Europe and Asia; substitute America - 
for each country in North America or South America or Caribbean. Show countries beginning with A or B

select name,
CASE WHEN continent='Europe' THEN 'Eurasia'
WHEN continent='Asia' THEN 'Eurasia'
WHEN continent='North America' THEN 'America'
WHEN continent='South America' THEN 'America'
WHEN continent='Caribbean' THEN 'America'
ELSE continent END
FROM world
WHERE name LIKE 'A%' or name LIKE 'B%'

13) Put the continents right...

Oceania becomes Australasia
Countries in Eurasia and Turkey go to Europe/Asia
Caribbean islands starting with 'B' go to North America, other Caribbean islands go to South America
Order by country name in ascending order
Test your query using the WHERE clause with the following:
WHERE tld IN ('.ag','.ba','.bb','.ca','.cn','.nz','.ru','.tr','.uk')
Show the name, the original continent and the new continent of all countries.

SELECT name AS Country, continent as Continent,
CASE WHEN continent='Oceania' THEN 'Australasia'
WHEN continent = 'Eurasia' THEN 'Europe/Asia'
WHEN name='Turkey' THEN 'Europe/Asia'
WHEN continent='Caribbean' AND name LIKE 'B%' THEN 'North America'
WHEN continent='Caribbean' AND name NOT LIKE 'B%' THEN 'South America'
ELSE continent END AS "New Continent"
FROM world
WHERE tld IN ('.ag','.ba','.bb','.ca','.cn','.nz','.ru','.tr','.uk')
ORDER BY Country;
