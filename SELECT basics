SELECT basics

1 ) Modify it to show the population of Germany

SELECT population FROM world
WHERE name = 'Germany'

2) Show the name and the population for 'Ireland', 'Iceland' and 'Denmark'.

SELECT name, population FROM world
WHERE name IN ('Ireland', 'Iceland', 'Denmark');

3) Which countries are not too small and not too big? BETWEEN allows range 
checking (range specified is inclusive of boundary values). The example 
below shows countries with an area of 250,000-300,000 sq. km. Modify it 
to show the country and the area for countries with an area between 200,000 
and 250,000.

SELECT name, area FROM world
WHERE area BETWEEN  200000 AND 250000
